#🌍 Multilingual Language Translator using NLP & Deep Learning

A deep learning-powered language translation system that supports translation across *8 major languages. This project demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP), **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq)* models, and *Transformer-based architectures* to build a multilingual translator capable of producing accurate, real-time translations.
